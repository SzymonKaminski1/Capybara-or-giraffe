# Capybara-or-giraffe
This project is about using CNN model to classify capibara and giraffe. During my work on this project I decided to use VGG19 model with data augmentation. I am using ROC curve AUC score to measure performance of my model. I am also using some test cases to figure out some features of prediction and to satisfy my curiosity.\
I am curently working on my own architecture to get the result I want.
My final goal is to correctly classify photo of giraffe figurine I got from my girlfriend.

I also want to confuse my model using this mysterious image!
